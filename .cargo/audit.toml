[advisories]
# Accepted low-severity wasmtime advisories
# Both require upgrading to wasmtime v33+/v36+ (major breaking change)
# Scheduled for resolution during wasmtime v34+ migration
#
# RUSTSEC-2025-0046: Host panic with fd_renumber WASIp1 function (severity 3.3)
# Mitigation: KAMI uses WASIp2 exclusively, fd_renumber is a WASIp1 function
#
# RUSTSEC-2025-0118: Unsound API access to shared linear memory (severity 1.8)
# Mitigation: KAMI does not use the shared memory APIs (memory.shared = false)
#
# RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste — unmaintained, transitive dep of wasmtime
# RUSTSEC-2025-0057: fxhash — unmaintained, transitive dep of wasmtime
